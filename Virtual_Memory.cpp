* Lets put a main function here. We can put each of our tests into separate
* text files, read them in, and then send them out to a class that will
* interpret the information. That class that interprets the information will
* contain the #include for project headers. We can also just leave all the 
* functions in here, and not have to worry about a different class. it doesn't
* matter to me either way.
